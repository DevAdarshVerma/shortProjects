	<h3>About the Book:</h3>
	<p>
	The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life is the second book by blogger and author Mark Manson. In it Manson argues that life's struggles give it meaning, and that the mindless positivity of typical self-help books is neither practical nor helpful. It was a bestseller.
	</p>

	<h3>My Review of the book:
	</h3>
	<p>
	If you aren't already a consumer of wisdom about life and death that the internet dispenses so generously, this book could hold some novelty value for you. But if you have had your fair share of disadvantages and disappointments in life, which made you look up google, then inwards and upwards, this book is just a rehash of the aforementioned internet wisdom, the ubiquity of which takes away a good part of its gravitas. 
	</p>

	<p>
	This book, essentially tries to showcase the transformational journey of an entitled "potty mouthed" youth, who through his failures, rejections and vicarious experience of death learns the values essential to lead a meaningful and satisfying life. But at no point of time I found myself admiring this man for his struggles and subsequent victories, probably because there wasn't anything significant or really daunting. Moreover the tone and tenor of the book hint at the existence of the same arrogant, entitled brat the author was before he chanced upon the wisdom he used as raw material for this book. 
	</p>

	<p>
	But there were pockets of sound advice or a very offbeat perspective that can come handy at times. 

The intent is noble, the language used in the book not so much and the experiences shared feel contrived. Especially the episode he narrates in the last chapter. 

The book is certainly targeted at youngsters who are yet to see life without any filters. Hopefully readers take home only the good and go beyond this book to become better versions of themselves.

What Critics says about the book
		</h3>
		<div class="blockquotes">
			<p>
		There's nothing subtle about Mark Manson. He's crude, vulgar and doesn't give a f*ck.

But like anything of true value in life, dig a little deeper and you'll find treasure worthy of any explorer willing to look below the surface.

A crude but much-needed reality check, this book proves that greatness can be discovered when we accept our ordinariness.

I found myself not wanting to put this book down. Manson’s witty dialogue and brutally honest truth-telling is a breath of fresh air when it comes to prioritizing what we care about in life. After all, it’s really all about “prioritizing better values, choosing better things to give a fuck about. Because when you give better fucks, you get better problems. And when you get better problems, you get a better life.
